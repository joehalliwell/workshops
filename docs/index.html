<h1>Machine Learning Workshops</h1>
<h2>http://joehalliwell.github.io/workshops</h2>
<p>Welcome! Follow these four(ish) simple(ish) steps to get going!</p>

<h2>0. Install Anaconda</h2>
<p>With any luck you've installed 
	<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Anaconda</a> already,
	but if not or if you had problems with it, one of our volunteers
	can help!</p>

<h2>1. Download the workshop "notebook"</h2>
<p>Right-click the relevant link below and <em>"Save link as..."</em> to your
	desktop, or documents folder. (The weird ".ipynb" extension is correct!)
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joehalliwell/workshops/master/ml-intro.ipynb" class="notebook">Workshop 1: Introduction to data science and machine learning with Pandas</a> wherein we use pandas, numpy, matplotlib,
	seaborn and scikit learn to model what it took to survive the wreck of the Titanic</li>
	<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joehalliwell/workshops/master/spark.ipynb" class="notebook">Workshop 2: Introduction to Apache Spark's MLLib</a> wherein we use Apache Spark and MLLib to gain insights into the madness of California real estate prices</li>
	<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joehalliwell/workshops/master/document-clustering.ipynb" class="notebook">Workshop 3: Topic extraction</a> wherein we use SpaCy and Scikit Learn to cluster a set of documents, learning about document vectors, analogies and 300D glasses along the way</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Start Jupyter</h2>
<p>Anaconda creates entries under the "Start" menu in Windows or
	the "Applications" folder in OSX. One of them should be for Jupyter notebook.</p>
<p>If you're in Linux, I reckon you've got this, but it'll be something like:</p>
<pre>root@elite:~# jupyter notebook</pre>
</p>
<h2>3. Open the notebook in Jupyter</h2>
<p>
Navigate to the folder where you put the "notebook" you downloaded in
step 2 and open it in Jupyter.
</p>
<h2>4. Have fun!</h2>
<p>The notebook will guide you through any additional steps.</p>

<h2>What to do if you get stuck</h2>

<p>The goal here is to <em>go at your own pace</em> and follow your nose.
	If you get distracted and end up ignoring the notebook
	altogether, that is <em>excellent</em>. If you end up reading
	through loads of background material to really understand
	something, that is <em>excellent</em>.</p>

<p><em>But</em> if you're getting stuck in a frustrating way, please holler.
	Our volunteers (and your neighbours...) are here to help.</p>

<h2>Feedback</h2>
